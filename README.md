# FileSorter

The FileSorter script is a command-line tool built in Python that helps you organize files in a specified directory. It automatically categorizes files into different folders based on their file types, such as photos, music, documents, videos, and others. It also includes a special category for to-ignore files. Additionnal features will be added in the future like allowing users to add their own categories .
